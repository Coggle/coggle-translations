login-pw-a-p1 = Coggle only supports Google Login, Microsoft Account Login or

    as these companies all provide very secure sign-in services, which support
    two-factor authentication and other account protection options.

login-pw-a-p2 = Storing usernames and passwords securely has a lot of 
    intricacy: password recovery, 2-factor authentication, fraud detection,
    brute-force attack detection, and securely storing hashed and salted
    passwords. We believe that leaving these tasks to an external provider is
    the right thing to do – leaving us more time to focus on creating a great
    mind-mapping experience.

login-switch-q = Can I switch between login methods?
login-switch-a = Yes! As long as you use the same email address with your Microsoft/Apple/Google accounts,

login-emails-q = Can you read my emails?
login-emails-a = No. We don't need, and don't want, access to your emails! 
    We just request your basic profile information. We don't have access to anything else, 
    and we can't change any setting on your Google/Microsoft account.

login-icloud-q = Can you access my iCloud?
login-icloud-a = No! Sign in with Apple just gives us access to your name, 
    and your email address (if you choose to share it). We don't have access to anything else. 
    You can read more about how sign in with apple works on 
    <a data-l10n-name="applehelp"> Apple's website</a>.
